YAVIN
=====

`Yet another vimrc ide node`

  git clone git://github.com/whatbirdisthat/vim-yavin.git ~/.vim
  ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
  cd .vim
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Yavin is about one thing: the TEXT . No fake metal borders,
no 'window', no 'menu', no 'toolbar', no 'death-star' -
just the actual TEXT.

Submodules
==========

Collected here are some highly useful tools for vim.

  01  easygrep
  02  gundo
  03  nerdcommenter
  04  nertree
  05  quickfixsigns
  06  syntastic
  07  tabular
  08  vcscommand
  09  vim-abolish
  10  vim-afterimage
  11  vim-commentary
  12  vim-endwise
  13  vim-fugitive
  14  vim-pathogen
  15  vim-repeat
  16  vim-surround
  17  vim-unimpaired
  18  vim-vividchalk


I don't always have all of these scripts turned on (eg why run
two commenters?) but I like them all the same, and it costs nothing
to subscribe to their trunk (or someone's mirror) with Github.


So Yavin is a vim ide, the focus is on responsiveness. And a nice
dark screen.

What Yavin needs:
=================

  1 `Goto definition`
      Being able to <leader>G jump to a function definition
      (workaround: use grep)
  2 `Deep autocomplete popups`
      Being able to tell vim where ZendFramework, Boost, pysvn etc
      are.
      (workaround: use grep)
  3 `*doc Help Window`
      Check for any *doc for the current function/class/namespace
      (guess what the workaround is)
  4 `Refactoring`
      ... see this is where we just command-tab over to netbeans
