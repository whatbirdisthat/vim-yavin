YAVIN
Yet another vimrc ide node

git clone me into ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc


Yavin is about one thing: the TEXT . No fake metal borders,
no 'window', no 'menu', no 'toolbar', no 'death-star' -
just the actual TEXT.

Yavin is also a celebration of the usefulness of GitHub.

Collected here are some highly useful tools for vim.

1 easygrep
2 gundo
3 nerdcommenter
4 nertree
5 quickfixsigns
6 syntastic
7 tabular
8 vcscommand
9 vim-abolish
10  vim-afterimage
11  vim-commentary
12  vim-endwise
13  vim-fugitive
14  vim-pathogen
15  vim-repeat
16  vim-surround
17  vim-unimpaired
18  vim-vividchalk

I don't always have all of these scripts turned on (eg why run
two commenters?) but I like them all the same, and it costs nothing
to subscribe to their trunk with Github.


So Yavin is a vim ide, the focus is on responsiveness. 

What Yavin needs:
  1 Goto definition
    Being able to <leader>G jump to a function definition
  2 Deep autocomplete popups
    Being able to tell vim where ZendFramework, Boost, pysvn etc
    are.
  3 *doc Help Window
    Check for any *doc for the current function/class/namespace
  4 Refactoring
      ... see this is where we just command-tab over to netbeans
